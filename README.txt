HelloMongo README

HelloMongo is an experiment in bringing together some of the public information from the MongoDB project into a single dashboard. For now, it pulls in mailing list activity, twitter feeds, GitHub commit logs and JIRA issues to give a snapshot of what is happening in the MongoDB community.

HelloMongo uses Twitter bootstrap for its look-and-feel and uses the zRSSFeed jQuery plugin to parse RSS feeds. HelloMongo is designed to work as a single HTML file and so doesn't require any application server or database infrastructure. www.hellomongo.com is hosted on a web accessible AWS S3 bucket.

If you have thoughts or questions, drop me an email at nosh.petigara@gmail.com. Enhancements and patches are, of course, welcome. More importantly, adapt the code or come up with new dashboards for your company. Transparency and openness are good.
